###Definition: git status

git status allows the user to see current status for the branch they are on; what the working directory looks like and the staging area.

*It will state the branch name.
*It will also tell the user the files that are currently untracked, changed, and what has been staged.
*It will also include comments that can be useful for the user to know what to do next/see what state the current directory is in.

All this can be done using the JupyterLab IDE under the Git tab, selecting 'Changes'.

This provides a visualization of the untracked, changed, and staged documents. They can be moved through these stages and finally be commited with a descriptive summary.
